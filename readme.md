Merged fix for the issues a user get &quot;Handle not found error&quot; error In Experiance Editor if the user delete page that has reference to another item (broken link dialog) (issue #103751) and when in multi-site Sitecore solutions, the Preview functionality of the Content Editor or Page Editor may incorrectly resolve the site the previewed item belongs to (issues #321270 and #321271).
